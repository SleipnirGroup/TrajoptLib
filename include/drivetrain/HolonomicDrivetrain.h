 * @brief This class represents a type of drivetrain that is holonomic.
 * Holonomic drivetrains have complete (or approximate) control over the three
 * degrees of freedom: position and rotation. For example, mecanum drivetrains
 * and swerve drivetrains can both manipulate their motors to have any overall
 * velocity vector while having any heading. Holonomic Drivetrain introduces no
 * new fields, but this inheritance structure is still used since it is logical
 * and maintains consistency with the rest of the api.
