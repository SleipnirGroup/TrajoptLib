/**
 * @brief This class represents an abstract robot with bumpers. The underlying
 * drivetrain could be differential, swerve, mecanum, omni, etc. This class
 * provides the common obstacle avoidance constraints and mass and moment of
 * inertia fields.
 *
 * The field coordinate system is the base system that is fixed to the field
 * with some arbitrary center. Other coordinate systems defined do not have a
 * relative velocity to the field coordinate system, but their position and
 * orientation depends on the current position of the robot. For example, if the
 * robot is spinning, then the robot has angular velocity relative to all the
 * systems defined here, and the magnitude of the robot's velocity is the same
 * in all the systems but the direction varies.
 *
 * We define these other systems: the robot coordinate system, the
 * robot nonrotating coordinate system, and the robot velocity coordinate
 * system. The robot coordinate system is centered on and oriented with the
 * front of the robot towards the x-axis. The robot nonrotating coordinate
 * system is centered on the robot but is oriented with the field. The robot
 * velocity coordinate system is centered on the robot and it is oriented with
 * the robot's velocity in the x-direction.
 *
 * Note that in differential drivetrains, the robot coordinate system
 * is equivalent ot the robot velocity coordinate system.
 *
 * The axis of rotation of the robot pierces through the origin of the robot
 * coordinate system and is normal to the plane of the field.
 *
 * Bumpers are represented as an obstacle. A bumper corner is analogous to an
 * obstacle point on the bumpers. The bumper corner points are specified
 * relative to the robot coordinate system. Using an obstacle as the robot's
 * bumpers is very powerful, as it is possible to create bumpers with rounded
 * corners, circular bumpers, rectanglar bumpers with two semi circles on side,
 * or many other shapes.
